@article{wolf78,
abstract = {The effect of coherent forward scattering must be taken into account when considering the oscillations of neutrinos traveling through matter. In particular, for the case of massless neutrinos for which vacuum oscillations cannot occur, oscillations can occur in matter if the neutral current has an off-diagonal piece connecting different neutrino types. Applications discussed are solar neutrinos and a proposed experiment involving transmission of neutrinos through 1000 km of rock.},

@article{Akhmedov2000,
abstract = {Neutrino oscillations in matter can exhibit a specific resonance enhancement -- parametric resonance, which is different from the MSW resonance. Oscillations of atmospheric and solar neutrinos inside the earth can undergo parametric enhancement when neutrino trajectories cross the core of the earth. In this paper we review the parametric resonance of neutrino oscillations in matter. In particular, physical interpretation of the effect and the prospects of its experimental observation in oscillations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos in the earth are discussed.},

@article{Kneller2013,
abstract = {Large amplitude oscillations between states of a quantum system can be stimulated by sinusoidal external potentials with frequencies that are equal to the energy level splitting of the states or a fraction thereof. We investigate this effect for neutrino oscillations both analytically and numerically finding a simple expression for amplitude and wavelength of the transitions as a function of the density, the amplitude and wavenumber of the fluctuation, and the matter mixing matrix elements. We apply our findings to the supernova environment and find that it is possible to predict stimulated transitions that occur due to sinusoidal perturbations in the density.},
