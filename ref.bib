abstract = {The effect of coherent forward scattering must be taken into account when considering the oscillations of neutrinos traveling through matter. In particular, for the case of massless neutrinos for which vacuum oscillations cannot occur, oscillations can occur in matter if the neutral current has an off-diagonal piece connecting different neutrino types. Applications discussed are solar neutrinos and a proposed experiment involving transmission of neutrinos through 1000 km of rock.},

@article{Petcov1998b,
abstract = {It is shown that the strong enhancement of the Earth (day-night) effect for solar neutrinos crossing the Earth core in the case of the small mixing angle MSW electron neutrino to muon (tau) neutrino transition solution of the solar neutrino problem is due to a new resonance effect in the solar neutrino transitions in the Earth and not just to the MSW effect in the core. The effect is in many respects similar to the electron paramagnetic resonance. The conditions for existence of this new resonance effect are discussed. They include specific constraints on the neutrino oscillation lengths in the Earth mantle and in the Earth core, thus the resonance is a ``neutrino oscillation length resonance''. The effect exhibits strong dependence on the neutrino energy. Analytic expression for the probability accounting for the solar neutrino transitions in the Earth, which provides a high precision description of the transitions, including the new resonance effect, is derived. The implications of our results for the searches of the day-night asymmetry in the solar neutrino experiments are briefly discussed. The new resonance effect is operative also in the muon neutrino to electron neutrino (electron neutrino to muon neutrino) transitions of atmospheric neutrinos crossing the Earth core.},

@article{kuo1989,
abstract = {Review is devoted to the systematic representation of the theory (first part) and the applications (second part) of neutrino oscillations in matter. The evolution equations for mixed neutrinos in matter are deduced in different forms and analized. The consideration includes symmetries, limits of applications and some generalizations of equations. The analogies of the mixed neutrinos in matter have been found. We discuss in details the properties and the physical sense of the resonance in a system of mixed neutrinos. For homogeneous matter the effect of resonant enhancement of oscillations is described. Different representation of the adiabaticity condition, which determines a dynamics of neutrino oscillations, are given, and the adiabaticity parameter is introduced. Practically complete transformations of one neutrino species into another one are possible at the adiabatic (or near to adiabatic) crossing of resonance layer even at small vacuum mixing. The effect of non-oscillatory transition is remarked. Some results have been obtained for the adiabaticity violation regime. Also we review the exact solutions of the equations for special density distributions. The generalization of the theory for the case of three neutrino mixing is given. The effects of inelastic collisions as well as the divergence of neutrino wave packets are discussed. The theory of resonant conversion is applied then to the neutrino fluxes inside the Sun, the Earth and the collapsing stars. The distortion of the neutrino energy spectra by the matter filters with different density distributions are calculated. We describe the observable effects of conversion for solar and atmospheric neutrinos as well as for neutrinos from collapsing stars. The searching for these effects is considered as a method of measuring the neutrino masses and mixing. Resonant conversion may quite naturally solve the solar neutrino problem. The distinctions of resonance conversion effects and another mechanisms for solar $\nu$e - flux reduction are considered, and in this connection the possibilities of solar neutrino spectroscopy are outlined. We discuss the consequences of $\nu$ - signal detection from supernova 1987A. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

We investigate this effect for neutrino oscillations both analytically and numerically finding a simple expression for amplitude and wavelength of the transitions as a function of the density, the amplitude and wavenumber of the fluctuation, and the matter mixing matrix elements. We apply our findings to the supernova environment and find that it is possible to predict stimulated transitions that occur due to sinusoidal perturbations in the density.},

@article{Duan2006a,
abstract = {We study the flavor evolution of a dense gas initially consisting of pure mono-energetic {\$}\backslashnu{\_}e{\$} and {\$}\backslashbar\backslashnu{\_}e{\$}. Using adiabatic invariants and the special symmetry in such a system we are able to calculate the flavor evolution of the neutrino gas for the cases with slowly decreasing neutrino number densities. These calculations give new insights into the results of recent large-scale numerical simulations of neutrino flavor transformation in supernovae. For example, our calculations reveal the existence of what we term the ``collective precession mode''. Our analyses suggest that neutrinos which travel on intersecting trajectories subject to destructive quantum interference nevertheless can be in this mode. This mode can result in sharp transitions in the final energy-dependent neutrino survival probabilities across all trajectories, a feature seen in the numerical simulations. Moreover, this transition is qualitatively different for the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies. Exploiting this difference, the neutrino signals from a future galactic supernova can potentially be used to determine the actual neutrino mass hierarchy.},

@article{Petcov2002,
abstract = {In the context of three-neutrino oscillations, we study the possibility of using antineutrinos from nuclear reactors to explore the 10-4 eV2 {\textless} ??m???2 ??? 8 ?? 10-4 eV2 region of the LMA MSW solution of the solar neutrino problem and measure ??m???2 with high precision. The KamLAND experiment is not expected to determine ??m???2 if the latter happens to lie in the indicated region. By analysing both the total event rate suppression and the energy spectrum distortion caused by v??e oscillations in vacuum, we show that the optimal baseline of such an experiment is L ??? (20-25) km. Furthermore, for 10-4 eV2 {\textless} ??m???2 ??? 5 ?? 10-4 eV2, the same experiment might be used to try to distinguish between the two possible types of neutrino mass spectrum - with normal or with inverted hierarchy, by exploring the effect of interference between the atmospheric- and solar-??m2 driven oscillations; for larger values of ??m???2 not exceeding 8.0 ?? 10-4 eV2, a shorter baseline, L ??? 10 km, would be needed for the purpose. The indicated interference effect modifies in a characteristic way the energy spectrum of detected events. Distinguishing between the two types of neutrino mass spectrum requires, however, a high precision determination of the atmospheric ??m2, a sufficiently large sin2 ?? and a non-maximal sin2 2?????, where ?? and ????? are the mixing angles, respectively, limited by the CHOOZ and Palo Verde data and characterizing the solar neutrino oscillations. It also requires a relatively high precision measurement of the positron spectrum in the reaction v??e + p ??? e+ + n. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
