We develop an interpretation of neutrino flavor conversions in fluctuating matter density based on Rabi oscillations. In certain limits, matter density fluctuations with single frequency modulates the neutrino flavor conversion similar to Rabi oscillations in optics. Adding more frequencies in matter fluctuations have complicated effects on the neutrino flavor conversions, which is interference between each frequencies. The interference is also explored and criteria of interference is proposed and verified numerically. By switching to a new basis, we are able to expand neutrino flavor conversions in matter with multiple-frequency fluctuations into superposition of Rabi oscillations. Using this technique we explain the relation between neutrino flavor conversions and Rabi oscillations by taking into account of the interference between different modes of Rabi oscillations more quantitatively.

\section{\label{introduction}Introduction}

In many astrophysical environments, such as core-collapse supernova,  neutrinos propagate through dense fluctuating medium, which will interact with neutrinos and dramatically change the flavor oscillations of neutrinos. Meanwhile, neutrinos deposit energy in matter during the interaction, where the amount of energy deposited depends on the flavor of neutrinos. The significance of matter effect on neutrino flavor oscillations has been demonstrated in Mikheyev–-Smirnov–-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect~\cite{Mikheev:1986gs,wolf78,wolfensteinprd1979}, which is used to explain the deficit of electron flavor neutrino flux, thus solved the solar neutrino problem~\cite{Petcov2002,kuo1989}. Later developments on the theories about matter effect revealed the parametric resonance of neutrino flavor oscillations due to fluctuations in matter density~\cite{Krastev1989,Akhmedov2000}, which is the neutrino analog of transitions between energy levels as a result of external optical stimulation. Parametric resonance is different from the MSW effect since it involves the parameters of the matter density, which is usually the period of matter density fluctuations. Neutrinos passing through inside the Earth can experience parametric resonance~\cite{Akhmedov1999, Petcov1998b}. 

As one of the most intense neutrino sources, supernova neutrinos experience turbulent matter density as they propagate through out the explosion~\cite{Muller2015, Couch2015}, where the flavor conversion is modified by interaction with matter. Meanwhile with neutrinos depositing energy into the shock, neutrino flavor conversion is crucial to the shock evolution of supernova explosion. The turbulent matter density environment for neutrino flavor conversion has been researched~\cite{Loreti1994, Friedland2006,Kneller2010}. Recently matter stimulated neutrino flavor conversion in varying matter density has been researched using Jacobi-Anger expansion by Kneller, et al.~\cite{Kneller2013,Patton2014}. They have shown that many stimulated neutrino flavor conversions can be explained by resonances of the system.

In this paper, we take a step further and interpret parametric resonance~\cite{Akhmedov2000, Krastev1989} as well as other matter stimulated neutrino flavor conversions~\cite{Kneller2013, Patton2014}, as superposition of Rabi oscillations. We also propose an criteria for the interference effect between different Rabi oscillations modes. In Sec.~\ref{sec:background}, we define the formalism of neutrino flavor conversions in matter used in this paper where the equation of motion and Hamiltonian for neutrino flavor conversion in matter are explicitly written. In Sec.~\ref{sec:single} we discuss how neutrino flavor conversions are related to Rabi oscillations. To begin with, we discuss a system with single frequency matter density fluctuation. We will show that such a system can be reduced to Rabi oscillations if resonance occurs. In Sec.~\ref{sec:multiple} we describe the interference effect between different frequencies of Rabi oscillations and develop the criteria for significant interference between two frequencies. As an example, we solve the neutrino flavor transitions in a castle wall matter profile, which is expanded using Fourier series into many single frequencies. We show that the interference between the many frequencies fits into the criteria we proposed for interference. In Sec.~\ref{sec:jacobi} we discuss the technique of decomposing the neutrino flavor conversions into summation of Rabi oscillations, by applying a specific unitary transformation and the Jacobi-Anger expansion. As the system is exactly decomposed into multiple Rabi oscillations, we can interpret neutrino flavor oscillations in any matter density fluctuations in principle.


% \fbox{TODO:more about oscillation in matter}

\section{\label{sec:background}Background and Formalism}

% \fbox{TODO: Explain why two flavor} didn't add this because the three flavor is really very different.

We consider two-flavor oscillation scenario, in which neutrinos have energy $E$ and mass-squared difference $\delta m^2$ between two mass states propagate through matter which is define by electron number density profile $n(r)$ along the path of neutrino propagation $r$.  The dynamics of neutrino flavor conversion is determined by Schr\"{o}dinger equation. In flavor basis the wave function describes the probability amplitude of different flavors. The Hamiltonian in flavor basis consists the vacuum oscillation Hamiltonian $H^{(f)}_{\mathrm v}$ and the matter term $H^{(f)}_{\mathrm{m}}$ which describes the interaction between neutrinos and matter,
\begin{align}
    H^{(\mathrm{f})} =&  H^{(f)}_{\mathrm v} + H^{(f)}_{\mathrm m} \nonumber\\
    =&  \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix}
    -\omega_{\mathrm{v}} \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm{v}} + \lambda(r) & \omega_{\mathrm{v}}\sin 2\theta_{\mathrm{v}} \\
   \omega_{\mathrm{v}} \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm{v}} & \omega_{\mathrm{v}} \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm{v}} - \lambda(r)
    \end{pmatrix},
\end{align}
where $\lambda(r)= \sqrt{2}G_{\mathrm F} n(r)$ is the potential of neutrino interaction with matter and $G_{\mathrm F}$ is the Fermi constant, $\theta_{\mathrm{v}}$ is the vacuum mixing angle, $\omega_{\mathrm{v}} = \delta m^2/2E$ is the vacuum oscillation frequency. The potential $\lambda(r)$ is called matter profile since it reflects the matter density fluctuations. For the convenience of notation, we use Pauli matrices $\sigma_i$ to rewrite the Hamiltonian, so that the Schr\"{o}dinger equation becomes,
\begin{equation*}
    \mathrm i\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d r}\Psi(r) = \frac{1}{2} \left(  
    (- \omega_{\mathrm{v}}\cos 2\theta_{\mathrm{v}} + \lambda(r) ) \sigma_3 + \omega_{\mathrm{v}}\sin 2\theta_{\mathrm{v}} \sigma_1 
    \right)
    \Psi(r),
\end{equation*}
where $\Psi(r)$ is the wave function in flavor basis. For two flavor scenario, it is written as $ \Psi(r) = \left(
    \psi_{e} ,
    \psi_{x}
    \right)^{\mathrm{T}}$ 
where $\psi_{e}$ and $\psi_{x}$ are the amplitudes for electron flavor and the second flavor ($\mu$ flavor or $\tau$ flavor) respectively. The equation of motion in flavor basis governs the transitions between different flavors.

For arbitrary matter profile, we can always interpret it as perturbations on top of a constant matter profile,
\begin{equation}
    \lambda(r) = \lambda_0 + \delta \lambda(r).
    \label{eq-general-matter-profile}
\end{equation}
For better understanding of the transition between states as a consequence of the fluctuation of matter density, we use the background matter basis, in which the Hamiltonian is diagonalized in the absence of perturbation $\delta\lambda(r)$, so that the Hamiltonian reads
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
    H^{(\mathrm{m})} = -\frac{\omega_m}{2} \sigma_3 + \frac{1}{2} \delta\lambda(r) \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \sigma_3 
     - \frac{1}{2} \delta\lambda(r) \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \sigma_1,
    \label{eq-hamiltonian-bg-matter-basis-general}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
where $\theta_{\mathrm m}$ is the mixing angle in a constant matter profile $\lambda_0$, which is calculated using relation
\begin{equation*}
\tan 2\theta_{\mathrm{m}}=\sin 2\theta_{\mathrm v}/\left( \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm v} - \lambda_0/\omega_{\mathrm v} \right)
\end{equation*}
with $\omega_{\mathrm v}$ denoting the vacuum oscillation frequency and $\theta_{\mathrm v}$ denoting the vacuum mixing angle. The frequency $\omega_{\mathrm m}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
\omega_{\mathrm{m}} = \omega_{\mathrm{v}} \sqrt{ ( \lambda_0/\omega_{\mathrm{v}} - \cos (2\theta_{\mathrm{v}}) )^2 + \sin^2(2\theta_{\mathrm{v}}) }.
\end{equation}

In background matter basis, the wave function describes the amplitudes of different mass states defined when there is only background matter density $\lambda_0$. It's trivial to calculate the flavor conversion given the transition probability between the two mass states. However, since we'll concentrate on the flavor conversion due to the matter fluctuations, we'll only discuss the transition between mass states in the background matter basis.

In this paper, mixing angle is chosen so that $\sin^2(2\theta_{\mathrm v}) = 0.093$ and the mass squared difference is $\delta m^2 = 2.6\times 10^{-3}\mathrm{eV}^2$.

\section{\label{sec:single}Single Frequency Matter Profile and Rabi oscillations}%


In this section we present a simple picture to explain neutrino parametric resonance in matter by utilizing the theory of Rabi oscillations which have been well studied in quantum optics~\cite{Boyd2008}. Rabi oscillations describes the transition between different energy levels due to an oscillatory external driving field, where maximum transition or resonance happens when the frequency of external driving field equals the energy gap. In Appendix~\ref{sec:rabi-oscillations}, we derive the Rabi oscillation transition probabilities using neutrino flavor isospin method introduced in Ref.~\onlinecite{Duan2006a}.

We examine neutrino flavor conversions in single frequency matter profile $\delta\lambda(r) = \lambda_1 \sin(k_1 r)$. As will be proved later, the varying $\sigma_3$ term $\delta\lambda(r) \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \sigma_3/2$ in Hamiltonian Eq.~(\ref{eq-hamiltonian-bg-matter-basis-general}), which is the varying energy gap due to varying matter density fluctuations, has little effect on the transition probabilities when the system is not far from resonance. With the varying $\sigma_3$ term removed, it indicates that this single frequency matter perturbation neutrino flavor conversion system is reduced to a Rabi oscillation system, with external driving field frequency $k_1$ and energy gap $\omega_{\mathrm m}$. We can also decompose $\sin( k_1 r )$ into two exponentials so that we have two external driving frequencies $k_1$ and $-k_1$. By neglecting the off-resonance mode which has a frequency $-k_1$, the Hamiltonian can be simplified,
% \begin{align}
% H^{(\mathrm{m})}_1 &= -\frac{\omega_{\mathrm m}}{2} \sigma_3 + \frac{1}{2} \lambda_1 \sin(k_1 r) \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \sigma_3 -\frac{1}{2}\lambda_1 \sin(k_1 r) \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \sigma_1 \\
% &\to -\frac{\omega_{\mathrm m}}{2} \sigma_3  -\frac{1}{2}\lambda_1 \sin(k_1 r) \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \sigma_1,
%     \label{eq-hamiltonian-bg-matter-basis-single-frequency}
% \end{align}
\begin{align}
H^{(\mathrm{m})} \to & -\frac{\omega_{\mathrm m}}{2} \sigma_3  - \frac{1}{2} \lambda_1 \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \sin( k_1 r ) \sigma_1\label{eq-hamiltonian-bg-matter-basis-single-frequency} \\
\to & -\frac{\omega_{\mathrm m}}{2} \sigma_3  - \frac{1}{2} A_1 \exp (k_1 r) \sigma_1 \nonumber \\
= & -\frac{\omega_{\mathrm m}}{2} \sigma_3  - \frac{1}{2} A_1 \cos ( k_1 r)  \sigma_1 + \frac{1}{2} A_1\sin(k_1 r) \sigma_2,\nonumber
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
A_1 = \frac{\lambda_1 \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm m} }{2i}.
\label{eq-define-a1}
\end{equation}

The resonance condition is determined by matching the energy gap $\omega_{\mathrm m}$ with external driving field frequency $k_1$, i.e., $\omega_{\mathrm m} \sim k_1$. As the system approaches resonance condition, the transition probability between the two mass states is predicted well using Rabi formula.

% For a graphical representation of such resonances, decompositions of Hamiltonian onto Pauli matrices are denoted as vectors on , c.f.~Appendix~\ref{sec:rabi-oscillations}. The Hamiltonian is decomposed into three different components, i.e., the constant energy gap on z axis $\vec H_z$, the varying perturbation on z axis $\vec H_{z}'$, and the rotating perturbations in xy plane $\vec H_{\pm}$. The frequency of the rotating component $H_{+}$ in the xy can easily match the energy gap $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ even with a varying $\vec H_z'$ component in the Hamiltonian vector, as long as the system is close to resonance.

To show that this conjecture of simplifying neutrino flavor conversions to Rabi oscillations is correct, we calculate transition probabilities of the neutrinos described by Eq.~(\ref{eq-hamiltonian-bg-matter-basis-general}) numerically, and compare them with Rabi formula Eq.~(\ref{rabi-system-transition-probability}) from the Rabi oscillations described by Eq.~(\ref{rabi-oscillation-single-perturbation}). 

In FIG.~\ref{fig-rabiOscillationsNeutrinoCoincidence}, we plotted the numerical results using markers as well as the prediction using Rabi formula using lines. The agreement between numerical solutions of neutrino transitions between mass states and Rabi formula will be explained more precisely in Sec.~\ref{sec:jacobi}. For now, we address the significance of relative detuning $\RD = \lvert k_1 - \omega_{\mathrm m} \rvert /\lvert A_1 \rvert$,  which is defined in Appendix~\ref{sec:rabi-oscillations}. It measures how off-resonance a system is. We know that $\RD\to 0$ indicates the system is very close to resonance, while $\RD\to \infty$ indicates the system is far away from resonance. The corresponding relative detunings are $0$, $0.5$, $1.0$, and $5.2$ for $k_1=\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$, $k_1=(1-10^{-4})\omega_{\mathrm m}$, $k_1=(1-2\times 10^{-4})\omega_{\mathrm m}$, and $k_1=(1-10^{-3})\omega_{\mathrm m}$.

For a single-frequency perturbation in matter profile $\lambda(r) =\lambda_1 +  \lambda_1\sin(k_1 r)$, P. Krastev and A. Smirnov concluded that the parametric resonance condition is $\omega_{\mathrm{m}} \sim n k_1$, if instantaneous $\omega_{\mathrm{m,inst}}(r)$ associated with the matter profile at distance $r$ varies slowly~\cite{Krastev1989}. This condition is exactly the Rabi resonance condition when $n=1$, as such condition matches the driving field frequency to the energy split. All the $n>1$ cases in their condition corresponds to the higher modes derived in Sec.~\ref{sec:jacobi}.

\section{\label{sec:multiple}Interference of Rabi Oscillations and Multiple Frequency Matter Profile}


The approach applied to single frequency matter profile also helps with the understanding of multiple frequency matter profile. However, multiple frequency matter profile leads to multiple modes of Rabi oscillations, even with our simplify approach by dropping the $\sigma_3$ term in Hamiltonian. In this section, we examine the interference between two modes of Rabi oscillations. Castle wall matter profile will serve as an example of multiple frequency profile to illustrate the idea of interference.

We explain the interference between different modes of Rabi oscillations using the idea of energy gap shift. Suppose we have a Rabi oscillation system with two modes, one mode at resonance with frequency $k_1$ and another mode with frequency $k_2$ that has off resonance. In some cases, there can be a significant transition amplitude decrease because of the off resonance frequency $k_2$, which can be interpreted as shift of energy gap due to the frequency $k_2$. To model the effect, we construct a Rabi oscillation Hamiltonian with two modes of different frequency,
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
H^{(\mathrm{m})}  = -\frac{\omega_{\mathrm{m}}}{2} \sigma_3 - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^N  A_n \cos (k_n r) \sigma_1 + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^N  A_n \sin (k_n r) \sigma_2,
\label{eq-hamiltonian-rabi-two-modes-interference}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
where $N=2$ for two frequency case. To show the destruction effect, the Hamiltonian Eq.~(\ref{eq-hamiltonian-rabi-two-modes-interference}) is reformed into a vector with sigma matrices as the basis,
\begin{equation}
\mathbf H = \begin{pmatrix}
0\\
0\\
\omega_m
\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}
A_1 \cos (k_1 r)\\
-A_1 \sin (k_1 r)\\
0
\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}
A_2 \cos (k_2 r)\\
-A_2 \sin (k_2 r)\\
0
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}

The three terms are defined as $\mathbf  H_3$, $\mathbf H_1$, and $\mathbf H_2$, where $\mathbf H_3$ is perpendicular to the other two vectors. To work out the energy gap shift, we go to the frame that corotates with $\mathbf H_2$, in which we have the new frequencies $k_1'=k_1-k_2$ and $k_2'=0$ as well as new energy gap $\omega_{\mathrm m}' = \omega_{\mathrm m}- k_2$. The resonance mode $\mathbf H_1$ retains the resonance condition since $k_1-k_2 = \omega_{\mathrm m}-k_2$ holds in the new frame. On the other hand, we have two static fields $\mathbf H_3$ and $\mathbf H_2$ together as the new energy gap, as long as $\mathbf H_2\ll \mathbf H_3$, which is the usual case. The new energy gap in this frame is calculated as
\begin{align}
    \tilde\omega_{\mathrm{m}}' =& \sqrt{\omega_{\mathrm{m}}'^2 + A_2^2 } \nonumber\\
    \approx & \omega_{\mathrm{m}}' + \frac{A_2^2}{2\omega_{\mathrm m}'} \nonumber\\
    =& \omega_{\mathrm m} - k_2 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{A_2^2}{\omega_{\mathrm m} - k_2},
    \label{eq-}
\end{align}
where we kept only first order of Taylor series. As an approximation, the transitions between the two energy states follows the Rabi oscillations with energy gap $\tilde \omega_{\mathrm m}$ and driving field with frequency $k_1-k_2$. Consequently, we can estimate how much the amplitude of the transition is suppressed due to $k_1$ mode by calculating the new relative detuning,
\begin{align}
    \RD' = \frac{\lvert k_1' - \tilde \omega_{\mathrm m}' \rvert}{\lvert A_1 \rvert} = \frac{\lvert k_1-\omega_{\mathrm m}\rvert}{\lvert A_1\rvert} + \frac{\lvert A_2^2 \rvert}{2 \lvert A_1 ( k_2 - \omega_{\mathrm m}) \rvert}.
\end{align}

The condition can be verified by comparing the numerical solution and estimation using Rabi formula. However, we are most interested in the amplitude change due to $\mathbf H_2$ mode. Relative detuning is the only variable that we need to calculate the amplitude, hence we only compare the numerical results with estimated amplitudes using $1/(1+\RD'^2)$.
To verify the condition, we choose the first rotating perturbation to satisfy the resonance condition $k_1=\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$, the condition for the second rotating field shifting the system out of resonance is that the relative detuning becomes larger than $1$, which leads to
\begin{equation}
\lvert A_2 \rvert \geq \sqrt{2\omega_{\mathrm{m}} \lvert A_1 (k_2-\omega_{\mathrm m})\rvert} \equiv A_{2,\mathrm{Critical}}.
\end{equation}
We expect the transition amplitude to decrease as we have larger $\lvert A_2\rvert$.

In all the calculations, we choose $A_1=10^{-4}\omega_{\mathrm m}$, $k_1=\omega_{\mathrm m}$. The grid lines are the transition amplitudes estimated using $\RD'$. During the calculation, $\Lambda_0$ is set to half of the MSW resonance potential, $\Lambda_0 = \frac{1}{2}\lambda_{\mathrm{MSW}}=\frac{1}{2}\omega_{\mathrm{v}}\cos 2\theta_{\mathrm v}$.}
                \label{fig-rabi-oscillations-energy-gap-change}
\end{figure}


We choose the two modes where the first one has amplitude $A_1 = 10^{-4}\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ and frequency $k_1 = \omega_{\mathrm{m}}$. With a small amplitude of the second frequency, $A_2=10^{-4}\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$, and large frequency $k_2=10\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$, we obtain almost full resonance. For larger $A_2$ the destruction effect is more effective, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-rabi-oscillations-energy-gap-change}. The estimation of transition amplitude is in good agreement with the numerical results. We also notice that the width of each cases doesn't change since we kept $A_1$ fixed for each calculation, which indicates that the decreasing in transition amplitude is because of the increasing in detuning.

Is it possible to have large flavor conversions when all other frequencies have large fluctuation amplitudes. It is possible when all of the other frequencies have periodic cancellations except for the resonance frequency. Fig.~\ref{fig-interference-reduction-three-modes-rabi} shows an intriguing phenomenon we observe. We construct a system with five frequencies. The first frequency is a perturbation that satisfies the resonance condition, while of the other two pairs of frequencies rotate in a different direction,
\begin{align}
    H^{(\mathrm{m})}  =& -\frac{\omega_{\mathrm{m}}}{2} \sigma_3 - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^N  A_n \cos (k_n r) \sigma_1 \nonumber\\
    &+ \frac{1}{2}A_1\sin(k_1 r) \sigma_2.
\label{eq-hamiltonian-rabi-two-modes-interference-3}
\end{align}
We choose the parameters so that with the first frequency only, the neutrino flavor conversions amplitude is large, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-interference-reduction-three-modes-rabi} as black line. Then we add in another pair of frequencies, which has a much smaller frequency. The amplitude of this pair of frequencies is chosen to be large enough to destroy the resonance of the first frequency. We observe the stepwise increase in the flavor conversions. Each step-like jump is the point where the potential of the second frequency becomes zero so that the resonance is restored. However, by adding a third frequency we have eliminated such resonance restored points since the matter potential of the combination of second and third frequency have no zero points within this range of calculation. This is another verification of our conjecture that the destruction of resonance is due to the energy gap shift, or equivalently the relative detuning.

\subsection{Castle Wall Matter Profile}



 Since any matter profile can be Fourier decomposed into superposition of many single frequency matter profile, we show an example of another well studied matter profile which is the periodic castle wall matter profile. The potential shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-castlewall-profile-illustration} is defined as,
\begin{equation}
    \lambda(r) = \begin{cases} 
\Lambda_1, &\quad -\frac{X_1}{2}+nX\le r\le \frac{X_1}{2}+nX \\
\Lambda_2, &\quad \frac{X_1}{2}+nX\le r\le \frac{X_1}{2}+\frac{X_2}{2} +nX
\end{cases}
\label{eq-castle-wall-potential}
\end{equation}
where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are the two periods of the matter profile or potential, $X=X_1+X_2$, and $n$ is integer. The parametric resonance condition derived by E. Akhmedov~\cite{Akhmedov2000} is,
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\tan (\omega_{\mathrm m1}X_1/2)}{\tan (\omega_{\mathrm m2}X_2/2)} = - \frac{\cos 2\theta_{\mathrm m2}}{\cos 2\theta_{\mathrm m1}},
\end{equation}
where $\omega_{\mathrm{m}i}$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{m}i}$ are the energy difference and mixing angle for potential $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ respectively.



Even though this castle wall problem is exactly solved, the condition itself is not transparent. In this subsection, we show that such a system is closed related to Rabi oscillations by making appropriate approximation, which will be be specifically proved in Sec.~\ref{sec:jacobi}.

For illustration purpose, we set the profile to be equal period for the two densities so that $X_1=X_2\equiv X/2$. To show that the neutrino flavor conversions in this castle wall matter profiles is related to Rabi oscillation, we decompose the profile using Fourier series,
\begin{equation}
\lambda(r) = \lambda_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \lambda_n \cos\left( k_n  r \right),
\label{eq-castle-wall-fourier-expanded}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{align*}
\lambda_0 &= (\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_2)/2, \\
\lambda_n & = \frac{2}{(2n-1)\pi}  (-1)^n  \left( \Lambda_1 -  \Lambda_2 \right),\\
k_n &= (2n-1)k_0, \\
k_0 &= 2\pi/X.
\end{align*}

To calculate the transitions between two mass states of background matter potential $\lambda_0$, we use the background matter basis with respect to $\lambda_0$, in which the transition is zero when varying matter profile vanishes. The Hamiltonian
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
H^{(\mathrm m)} = - \frac{1}{2}\omega_{\mathrm m} \sigma_3  + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \lambda_n \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \cos\left( k_n  r \right)  \sigma_3 - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \lambda_n \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm m}  \cos\left( k_n r \right) \sigma_1,
\label{castle-wall-decomposed-hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
determines the transitions between the two background matter states.

In principle, the base frequency $k_0$ which is determined by the total period $X$ can be arbitrary. In this example, we choose a $X$ so that the base frequency $k_0$ matches the energy gap $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$. Even though multiple perturbation frequencies show up in Eq.~(\ref{castle-wall-decomposed-hamiltonian}), we identify that only the first frequency $n=1$ is the resonance frequency since we are using $k_0=\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$. As an approximation, we drop all other frequencies $n>1$ regarding the fact that they are off-resonance. Thus, similar to single frequency matter profile, the varying $\sigma_3$ terms have limited effects on the transition probabilities in our case, which leads to
\begin{align*}
    H^{(\mathrm m)} \to & - \frac{1}{2}\omega_{\mathrm m} \sigma_3  - \frac{1}{2} \lambda_1 \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm m}  \cos\left( k_0 r \right) \sigma_1\\
    \to & - \frac{1}{2}\omega_{\mathrm m} \sigma_3  - \frac{1}{2} A_1 \cos ( k_0 r) \sigma_1 + \frac{1}{2} A_1 \sin(k_0 r) \sigma_2,
\end{align*}
where
\begin{equation*}
A_1 = \frac{\lambda_1 \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm m} }{2} .
\end{equation*}


FIG.~\ref{fig-akhmedovOscPlt} shows the neutrino transition probabilities between the two matter states for different $\Lambda_2-\Lambda_1$. For small $\Lambda_2-\Lambda_1$, the Rabi formula prediction using the resonance frequency $k_0=\omega_{\mathrm m}$ matches the numerical results. The reason is that the resonance widths of each other frequencies are small compared to the detunings defined by $k_n-\omega_{\mathrm m}$, so that the interference between the resonance mode and all other modes are small. We notice larger deficit between Rabi formula predictions and numerical results for large $\Lambda_2-\Lambda_1$. The transition amplitude drops for larger fluctuations $\Lambda_2-\Lambda_1$. The essence of this phenomenon is that the high frequencies interference with the low frequency frequency which is at resonance. More precisely, the resonance in Fig.~\ref{fig-akhmedovOscPlt-a} and resonance destruction effect in Fig.~\ref{fig-akhmedovOscPlt-b} is qualitatively described the comparison of relative detunings of different frequencies. The salient feature of this Fourier series expanded matter profile Eq.~(\ref{eq-castle-wall-fourier-expanded}) is that the width of each frequency decreases as the order $n$ increases while the detuning of each frequency increases. We calculate the relative detuning for each frequency
\begin{equation}
Q_n = \frac{\lvert k_n -\omega_{\mathrm m} \rvert}{ \lvert \lambda_n  \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm m}/2 \rvert } = \frac{2(n-1)(2n-1)\pi \omega_{\mathrm m}}{(\Lambda_2 - \Lambda_1)\sin 2\theta_{\mathrm m}}
\end{equation}
which is quadratic in $n$ and inversely proportional to $\Lambda_2-\Lambda_1$. Table~\ref{tab-q-values-each-mode} lists the relative detuning for each frequency in Fig.~\ref{fig-akhmedovOscPlt-a} and Fig.~\ref{fig-akhmedovOscPlt-b}. Since the higher order relative detunings $Q_n$ for $n\geq 2$ are much larger than 1 for $\Lambda_2-\Lambda_1 = 0.003\pi\Lambda_0$, we expect the term with frequency $k_1$ dominates. In the other situations, the $Q_2$ term is small which indicates a possible interference between $k_2$ and $k_1$ frequency. 
%We perform the approximation Eq.~(\ref{eq-new-q-value-by-adding-new-long-wavelength-mode}) for the Fourier series expanded castle profile and include only the first two frequencies since higher frequencies terms have very large $Q$'s. We find the relative detuning $Q_1$ change from $0$ to $0.001$ and $1$ for $\Lambda_2-\Lambda_1 = 0.003\pi\Lambda_0$ and $\Lambda_2-\Lambda_1 =3.065\pi\Lambda_0$ respectively. A very small relative detuning $Q_1'=0.001$ have almost no effect on the transition amplitude which is what we observe in Fig.~\ref{fig-akhmedovOscPlt-a}, while $Q_1'=1$ will supress the amplitude by half, which mathches what is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-akhmedovOscPlt-b}.

\section{\label{sec:jacobi}Parametric Resonance and Rabi oscillation --- Jacobi-Anger expansion}


With the intuition of the Rabi oscillation itself as well as the interference with long wave length mode shown in Sec.~\ref{sec:multiple}, we can interpret the transition probabilities of any matter profile more precisely if the system can be exactly decomposed into multiple Rabi oscillations. In this section, we show that the matter effect can be decomposed into superpositions of Rabi oscillations by applying a Jacobi-Anger expansion to the Hamiltonian. Similar trick has been used in Ref.~\onlinecite{Kneller2013}. However, we take a different approach by applying a unitary transformation first which make the motivation of Jacobi-Anger expansion, then write the final result as superpositions of Rabi oscillation. For a system with general matter perturbation, c.f. Eq.~(\ref{eq-hamiltonian-bg-matter-basis-general}), we apply an unitary transformation of the form
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{U} =  \begin{pmatrix} e^{-i \eta (r)} & 0 \\  0 & e^{i \eta (r)}  \end{pmatrix},
    \label{eq-rabi-transformation}
\end{equation}
which is a transformation used in Ref.~\onlinecite{Kneller2006} to remove the diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian. In this work, this transformation is used to remove the varying $\sigma_3$ terms $\delta\lambda(r) \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \sigma_3/2$ in the Hamiltonian, so that the energy gap is fixed in the new basis $\left(\ket{\nu_{\mathrm{r1}}},\ket{\nu_{\mathrm{r2}}}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}$, which is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix} \ket{\nu_{\mathrm{r1}}}\\ \ket{\nu_{\mathrm{r2}}} \end{pmatrix} =  \mathbf{U}^\dagger \begin{pmatrix} \ket{\nu_{\mathrm{L}}} \\ \ket{\nu_{\mathrm{H}}} \end{pmatrix}.
    \label{eq-rabi-basis}
\end{equation}
For convenience, we name this unitary transformation Rabi transformation in Eq.~(\ref{eq-rabi-transformation}) as well as the new basis in Eq.~(\ref{eq-rabi-basis}) the Rabi basis. In Rabi basis, we find the Schr\"{o}dinger equation
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{pmatrix}  \frac{\mathrm d\eta}{\mathrm dr}  & 0 \\ 0 & - \frac{\mathrm d\eta}{\mathrm d r}  \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{\mathrm R1} \\ \psi_{\mathrm R2} \end{pmatrix} + \mathrm i \frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dr} \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{\mathrm R1} \\ \psi_{\mathrm R2} \end{pmatrix} 
    =
\left[ -\frac{\omega_{\mathrm m} }{2} \sigma_3  + \frac{\delta \lambda}{2} \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm m}  \sigma_3  - \frac{\delta \lambda}{2} \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & e^{2\mathrm i\eta} \\ e^{-2 \mathrm i\eta } & 0 \end{pmatrix}   \right] \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{\mathrm R1} \\ \psi_{\mathrm R2} \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation*}
\end{widetext}
in which the varying diagonal elements in Hamiltonian can be eliminated by choosing $\eta(x)$ properly, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
    \eta(x) - \eta(0) =  \frac{\cos 2\theta_{\mathrm{m}}}{2} \int_0^x \delta\lambda (\tau) d\tau.
\end{equation}
In Rabi basis, the Schr\"{o}dinger equation becomes
%\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation*}
    i \frac{d}{dx} \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{\mathrm r1} \\ \psi_{\mathrm r2} \end{pmatrix} = \left[ - \frac{\omega_{\mathrm m}}{2} \sigma_3 - \frac{\delta \lambda}{2} \sin 2\theta_m \begin{pmatrix} 0 & e^{2i\eta} \\ e^{-2 i\eta } & 0 \end{pmatrix}\right] \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{\mathrm r1} \\ \psi_{\mathrm r2} \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation*}
%\end{widetext}
where $\eta(x) = - A_1 \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \cos (k_1 x)/(2 k) $ for single frequency matter profile with potential $\delta\lambda(x) = A_1\sin(k_1x)$.  One can easily show that the transition probability between two eigenstates in Rabi basis is the same as the transition probability between two eigenstates in background matter basis.

To make connection with Rabi oscillation, we apply Jacobi-Anger expansion, which is used in Ref.~\onlinecite{Kneller2013}, to decompose the $\exp\left( i z \cos\left(k_1 r \right) \right)$-like term in Hamiltonian into linear combinations of terms that is proportional to $\exp\left(i n k_1 r \right)$, i.e., to decompose spherical waves into plane waves. The decomposed form of Hamiltonian explicitly shows that the Hamiltonian is a summation of Rabi systems, which is
%\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation*}
    H^{(\mathrm{R})} = 
    -\frac{\omega_{\mathrm{m}}}{2} 
    -  \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty B_n \begin{pmatrix}
    0 &  \Phi_n e^{\mathrm i n k_1  r} \\
     \Phi_n^* e^{ - \mathrm i n k_1 r} & 0
    \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation*}
%\end{widetext}
where
\begin{align*}
    B_n &= \tan 2\theta_{\mathrm m} n k_1 J_{n} \left( \frac{A_1}{k_1}\cos 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \right),\\
    \Phi_n &= e^{i\pi (3n/2+1)},
\end{align*}
with $J_n$ standing for the Bessel function.
The constant phase $\Phi_n$ doesn't play any role for the reason discussed in Appendix~\ref{sec:rabi-oscillations}. Phase in matter potential would also go into $\Phi_n$, for which reason, phase is not included in the current problem. The first term in Hamiltonian describes the energy gap, while the second term is the summation of many driving fields. The resonance width for a given mode $n$ is $\lvert B_{n}\rvert$. It's worth mentioning that for large $n$, we have~\cite{Ploumistakis20092897}
\begin{equation}
J_n(n \sech \alpha) \sim \frac{ e^{n(\tanh\alpha - \alpha)} }{\sqrt{ 2\pi n \tanh \alpha } }.
\end{equation}
It's straightforward to prove that resonance width decreases dramatically for large $n$ thus higher order modes become insignificant.



When the system has one dominate resonance mode and without significant interference between the resonance mode and other modes, all off-resonance modes can be dropped without significantly changing the transition probabilities. However, as we have shown previously in Sec.~\ref{sec:multiple}, interference might happen between different modes. A qualitative measure should be introduced so that we know what the conditions are for dropping other modes. The following subsections will determine the important modes of the system (i.e., which $n$ to include) and explore the interference between modes hence explain the coincidence presented in the previous sections. For numerical calculations, we use dimensionless quantities which are scaled using the characteristic energy scale $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$, e.g.,
\begin{align*}
    \hat r &= \omega_{\mathrm{m}}r, \\
    \hat k_1 & = \frac{k_1}{\omega_{\mathrm{m}}}, \\
    \hat A_1 & = \frac{A_1}{\omega_{\mathrm{m}}}, \\
    \hat B_n &= \frac{B_n}{\omega_{\mathrm{m}}}.
\end{align*}

Through the Rabi transformation and Jacobi-Anger expansion, the varying diagonal elements in Hamiltonian, i.e., varying $\sigma_3$ term, is transformed to a perturbing field with many different frequencies $n k_1$.






\subsection{The Important Factors}


% \fbox{
% \parbox{0.9\columnwidth}{
% \begin{itemize}
%             \item Width of resonance $B$
%             \item Deviation from exact resonance $g$, called {\bf{detuning}} (value).
%             \item Oscillation wavelength of mode (determined by Rabi frequency, which is in turn related to $B$ and $g$ ) compared to size of physical system
% \end{itemize}
% }}


To determine the important modes and justify the approximations used in Sec.~\ref{sec:single} and Sec.~\ref{sec:multiple}, the resonance width for each mode which is determined by $B_n$, the deviation from exact resonance (i.e., detuning) which is calculated as $\lvert n k_1 - \omega_{\mathrm{m}} \rvert$, and oscillation wavelength of each mode compared to the size of the physical system should be considered.

% By utilizing the theory of Rabi oscillation, we know that the oscillation wavelength of each mode is determined by the Rabi frequency $\Omega_n$.

More specifically, we define the resonance quality of each mode using the reciprocal of scaled detuning 
　\begin{equation}
　Q_n = \lvert B_n/( n k_1 - \omega_{\mathrm{m}}  )\rvert,
　\end{equation}
which measures how well the resonance is. For exact resonance, $Q_n=0$, while large $Q_n$ says the system is too far away from the resonance of this specific mode. Small $Q_n$ modes are the modes that are dramatically important to the system. Meanwhile, modes that has much larger oscillation wavelength are not subjected to be considered even though their $Q_n$'s are close to zero, which is due to the fact that such modes have not accumulated much transition probabilities within the size of the physical system.

Similar quantities are to be considered for multi-frequency matter profile, such as the resonance width of each mode $B_N$, detuning $\lvert \sum_a n_a k_a - \omega_{\mathrm{m}} \rvert$, and Rabi frequency $\Omega_N$, as well as $Q_N =\lvert B_N/( \sum_a n_a k_a - \omega_{\mathrm{m}}  )\rvert$. 

In principle, we can always approximate the system by including more modes with larger relative detuning while neglecting the modes with wavelength much longer than the size of physical system. Notheless such effort doesn't simplify the calculations.




\subsection{Single Frequency Matter Profile}

For the single frequency matter potential $\lambda = \lambda_0 + \lambda_1 \sin(k_1 r)$ discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:single}, we removed the varying $\sigma_3$ term by arguing that this term has no effect on transition probabilities when the system is close to resonance, $k_1 \sim \omega_{\mathrm m}$. The reason is that only the first mode $n=1$ is on resonance when $k_1=\omega_{\mathrm m}$ and all other modes are far from resonance, thus
\begin{align}
H^{\mathrm R} \approx & -\frac{\omega_{\mathrm m}}{2}\sigma_3 - \frac{1}{2} B_1 \begin{pmatrix}
0 & \Phi_1 e^{i k_1 r} \\
\Phi_1^* e^{-ik_1r} & 0
\end{pmatrix}\label{eq-single-frequency-first-mode-hamiltonian} \\
\approx & -\frac{\omega_{\mathrm m}}{2} \sigma_3 - \frac{A_1}{2} \cos(k_1 r) \sigma_1 + \frac{A_1}{2} \sin(k_1 r) \sigma_2\nonumber,
\end{align}
where $A_1$ is defined in Eq.~(\ref{eq-define-a1}) and approximation
\begin{equation*}
J_1\left( \frac{\lambda_1}{k_1}\cos (2\theta_{\mathrm m}) \right) \approx \frac{\lambda_1}{2k_1}\cos (2\theta_{\mathrm m})
\end{equation*}
for small $\lambda_1\cos(2\theta_{\mathrm m})/k_1$ is used in the last step. Thus we reach a similar equation to the approximation we used in Sec.~\ref{sec:single}. Small $\lambda_1\cos(2\theta_{\mathrm m})/k_1$ corresponds to small resonance width for Eq.~(\ref{eq-hamiltonian-bg-matter-basis-single-frequency}) and also Eq.~(\ref{eq-single-frequency-first-mode-hamiltonian}) so that the interferences are small. For $\lambda_1 \cos(2\theta_{\mathrm{m}})/k_1\gg 1$, the resonance width is very large compared to $\lvert n k_1 - \omega_{\mathrm{m}}$, which is the distance between different order of resonances, thus bringing in the interference between different modes. The relative detuning for each mode in the Jacobi-Anger expansion for single frequency matter profile used in Fig.~\ref{fig-rabiOscillationsNeutrinoCoincidence} is calculated, which shows that the relative detuning of the first mode is $0$, while the relative detuning of the second and third mode are $1.1\times 10^9$ and $9.7\times 10^{13}$ which are too huge to have any effect on the overall transition probability.







\subsection{Multifrequency Matter Profile}

The interference effect shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-interference-reduction-three-modes} is also interpretable by means of Jacobi-Anger expansion. Table~\ref{tab-q-values-lambda-each-mode-interference} shows the smallest relative detunings and corresponding oscillation wavelength of each mode. As expected, the third frequency introduced many small relative detuning modes, which interferes more compared to the two frequency cases.

A matter profile as complicated as the castle wall profile can be decomposed into a summation of multiple frequencies. Even for arbitrary multi-frequency matter potential
\begin{equation}
    \lambda(r) = \lambda_0 + \sum_n A_n \sin (n k_n r),
\end{equation}
the Hamiltonian also takes a form of summation of Rabi oscillations,
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
    H^{(\mathrm R)} = -\frac{\omega_{\mathrm m}}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n_1=-\infty}^\infty \cdots \sum_{n_N = -\infty}^\infty B_{\{n_i\}} 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & \Phi_{\{n_i\}} e^{i\left( \sum_a n_a k_a \right)r} \\
    \Phi_{\{n_i\}}^* e^{-i\left( \sum_a n_a k_a \right)r} & 0
    \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
where
\begin{align*}
    B_{\{n_i\}} &=  \tan 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \left( \sum_a n_a k_a \right) \left( \prod_a J_{n_a}\left( \frac{A_a}{k_a}\cos 2\theta_m \right) \right),\\
    \Phi_{\{n_i\}} &= e^{i\pi (3\sum_a n_a/2+1)},
\end{align*}
which is similar to the single frequency matter potential Hamiltonian. A mode is defined by a certain choice of $n_1,\cdots,n_N$. As defined for single frequency matter profile, a relative detuning can also be defined for multi-frequency matter profile
\begin{equation}
    Q_{\{n_i\}} = \frac{\lvert \sum_a n_a k_a - \omega_{\mathrm m} \rvert }{\lvert B_{\{n_i\}} \rvert}.
\end{equation}

As the number of frequencies becomes large, the resonance modes are easily clogged together since many set of $\{n_i\}$'s can be chosen so that the relative detunings are all close to 0. Resonance modes that has oscillation wavelength much larger than the physical system such as supernova explosion are neglected since these modes have not developed large transition probabilities within the size of the physical system. On the other hand, long wavelength modes are the source of resonance destruction for short wavelength resonance modes, as shown in Sec.~\ref{sec:interference-with-long-wavelength-mode}.








\section{\label{conclusions}Conclusions}

%%%% Do not repeat what has been said


In conclusion, we have provided an interpretation for neutrino flavor conversion in fluctuating matter with the help of Rabi oscillations. The work provided two different points of view that is related to Rabi oscillations. The first point of view was to interpret the neutrino flavor conversions in background matter basis. In this basis, matter density fluctuations will introduced a fluctuation part to the diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian, which means that the energy gap is fluctuating if we draw analogy between this Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian of Rabi oscillations. For neutrino flavor conversions in a single frequency matter profile, the neutrino flavor oscillations becomes large when the matter fluctuation frequency is close to the energy gap. This condition is one of the resonance conditions. We anticipated that the fluctuations of energy gap have limited effects on neutrino flavor conversions under resonance conditions. Thus the matter fluctuation only works as a pure flipping field that converts neutrinos from one flavor to another. 

As we added more frequencies of matter density fluctuations, the neutrino flavor conversions becomes more nontrivial due to the interferences between the difference matter profile frequencies. To quantify the effect, we defined relative detuning which describes how off-resonance a Rabi oscillation is. In the case of single frequency matter profile, the relative detuning becomes $0$ under the resonance condition. In general, we construct a relative detuning for each frequencies to measure possible interference between them. If only one of the frequencies has relative detuning close to $0$ while all other frequencies have very large relative detunings, we have only one dominate frequency. Otherwise, interference between the different frequencies will have dramatic effect on the neutrino flavor conversions. One of the case that can be more quantified is the interference between short wavelength perturbation and long wavelength perturbation. We also showed that it can be explained using relative detuning. In Rabi oscillations, we choose a high frequency matter profile, which is on-resonance and a low frequency matter profile, which is off-resonance. The interference effect between them is because of the energy gap is shifted due to the long wavelength fluctuations. Consequently, the strength of interference can be measured by modification of relative detuning due to the shift of energy gap.

Neutrino flavor conversions in matter can also be described in a basis where the oscillations are consequences of superposition of Rabi oscillations, which are modes of oscillations. This view was applied to emphasis the approximations that the change of energy gap due to matter fluctuation can be neglected under resonance condition in the previous background matter basis. The destruction effect due to multiple frequencies matter profile was also explained as the interference between different modes. If only one mode has a close to zero relative detuning while all other modes have much larger relative detunings, only the one with small relative detuning dominates the neutrino flavor conversion. Otherwise, interferences serves as a destruction effect of the neutrino flavor conversion.

\end{figure}

In this appendix we introduce flavor isospin \cite{Duan2006a} to Rabi oscillations and derive the transition probabilities as well as explain the resonance and width briefly.


The Hamiltonian for Rabi oscillation is
\begin{equation}
    H_{\mathrm R} = -\frac{\omega_{\mathrm R}}{2}\sigma_3 - \frac{A_{\mathrm{R}} }{2}  \left( \cos(k_{\mathrm{R}} t +\phi_{\mathrm{R}})\sigma_1  - \sin(k_{\mathrm{R}} t +\phi_{\mathrm{R}}) \sigma_2\right),
    \label{rabi-oscillation-single-perturbation}
\end{equation}
in which $\omega_{\mathrm R}$ serves as the energy split of the two level system, while $A_{\mathrm{R}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{R}}$ are the strength and frequency of the driving field, respectively. A decomposition of the second term shows that
\begin{equation*}
H_{\mathrm R} 
= - \frac{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2} \cdot (\mathbf{H}_3 + \mathbf{H}_+ ) ,
\end{equation*}
where $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is the the vector of Pauli matrices, and the three vectors are
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{H}_3 = & \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\ 0 \\ \omega_{\mathrm R}
    \end{pmatrix}, \\
    \mathbf{H}_+ = & \begin{pmatrix}
    A_{\mathrm{R}} \cos(k_{\mathrm{R}} t +\phi_{\mathrm{R}}) \\
    - A_{\mathrm{R}} \sin(k_{\mathrm{R}} t +\phi_{\mathrm{R}}) \\
    0
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}

The three vectors are mapped onto a Cartesian coordinate system, so that $\mathbf{H}_3$ is the vector aligned with the third axis, $\mathbf{H}_+$ is a rotating vectors in a plane perpendicular to $\mathbf{H}_3$. The wave function $\Psi=(\psi_1,\psi_2)^{\mathrm{T}}$ is also used to define the state vector $\mathbf{s}$
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{s} =& \Psi^\dagger \frac{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}\Psi \\
    =& \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
    2\,\mathrm{Re}\,(\psi_1^* \psi_2) \\
    2\,\mathrm{Im}\,(\psi_1^*\psi_2) \\
    \lvert \psi_1 \rvert^2 - \lvert \psi_2 \rvert^2
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
The third component of $\mathbf{s}$, which is denoted as $s_3$, is within range $[-1/2,1/2]$. The two limits, $s_3=-1/2$ and $s=1/2$ stand for the system in high energy state and low energy state respectively. $s_3=0$ if the system has equal probabilities to be on high energy state and low energy state. The Schr\"odinger equation becomes
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t } \mathbf{s} = \mathbf{s} \times \mathbf{H},
\end{equation}
which is the precession equation. For static $\mathbf{H}$, the state vector $\mathbf{s}$ precess around $\mathbf{H}$. 

In a frame that corotates with $\mathbf{H}_+$, which is described in Fig.~\ref{fig-rabi-isospin-rotating-frame}, the new Hamiltonian is
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d t } \mathbf{s} = \mathbf{s} \times (\mathbf{H}'_3 + \mathbf{H}‘_+),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H}'_3 = \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\ 0 \\ 　\omega_{\mathrm{R}} - k_{\mathrm R}
    \end{pmatrix}, \qquad \mathbf{H}'_+ = \begin{pmatrix}
    A_{\mathrm{R}} \\ 0 \\ 　0
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
The state vector $\mathbf{s}$ precess around a static vector $\mathbf{H}'_3 + \mathbf{H}'_+$ with a frequency $\Omega_{\mathrm R} = \sqrt{ \lvert A_{\mathrm{R}}\rvert^2 + (k_{\mathrm{R}} - \omega_{\mathrm R})^2 }$. A geometric analysis by projecting the state vector $\mathbf{s}$ on to the verticle axis shows that
\begin{equation}
s_3 = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{\lvert A_{\mathrm R}\rvert ^2}{\Omega_{\mathrm R}^2}\sin^2\left(\frac{\Omega_{\mathrm R}}{2} t\right).
\end{equation}
Resonance occurs when the term $\mathbf{H}_3$ disappears in this corotating frame, since the state vector $\mathbf{s}$ converts completely between $+1/2$ (low energy state) and $-1/2$ (high energy state).



Such a system has analytical transition probability from low energy state to high energy state
\begin{equation}
    P(r) = \frac{1}{2}(1- 2 s_3(r))= \frac{\left \lvert A_{\mathrm{R}} \right \rvert ^2}{ \Omega_{\mathrm R}^2 } \sin^2 \left( \frac{\Omega_{\mathrm R}}{2} t \right),
    \label{rabi-system-transition-probability}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\mathrm R} = \sqrt{ \lvert A_{\mathrm{R}}\rvert^2 + (k_{\mathrm{R}} - \omega_{\mathrm R})^2 }
\end{equation} is known as Rabi frequency. The detuning, which is defined by $k_{\mathrm{R}} - \omega_{\mathrm R}$, determines how off-resonance the system is, and amplitude of driving field $A_{\mathrm{R}}$ determines the resonance width,
\begin{align}
\text{Detuning} =&~\lvert k_{\mathrm{R}} - \omega_{\mathrm R} \rvert, \\
\text{Resonance Width} =&~\lvert A_{\mathrm R} \rvert.
\end{align}
The transition probability oscillates with frequency $\Omega_{\mathrm R}$. However, the amplitude $A_1$ is the dominate factor for oscillation frequency when the system is close to resonance. The phase of the matter potential $\phi_{\mathrm{R}}$ has no effect on the transition probability since it only determines the initial phase of driving Hamiltonian vector $\mathbf{H}_+$. We also notice that the transition amplitude is determined by relative detuning $\RD$, which is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \RD = \left\lvert \frac{ k_{\mathrm R} - \omega_{\mathrm R}}{A_{\mathrm R}} \right\rvert.
\end{equation}


Given a Rabi oscillation system with two driving frequencies
\begin{align*}
    H_{\mathrm R} =& -\frac{\omega_{\mathrm R}}{2}\sigma_3 - \frac{A_{1} }{2}  \left( \cos(k_{1} t +\phi_{1})\sigma_1  - \sin(k_{1} t +\phi_{1}) \sigma_2\right) \nonumber\\
    & - \frac{A_{2} }{2}  \left( \cos(k_{2} t +\phi_{2})\sigma_1  - \sin(k_{2} t +\phi_{2}) \sigma_2\right)
\end{align*}
we decompose it into $\mathbf{H}_{\mathrm R}=\mathbf{H}_3 + \mathbf{H}_{1} + \mathbf{H}_2$, where
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{H}_1 =  \begin{pmatrix}
     A_{1} \cos(k_{1}t+\phi_{1}) \\
     A_{1} \sin(k_{1}t+\phi_{1})  \\
     0
      \end{pmatrix},   \mathbf{H}_2 =  \begin{pmatrix}
     A_{2} \cos(k_{2}t+\phi_{2}) \\
     A_{2} \sin(k_{2}t+\phi_{2})  \\
     0
      \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
Assume $\mathbf{H}_1$ is the on-resonance perturbation which requires $k_1 = \omega_{\mathrm{R}}$. The most general condition that we can drop the new perturbation $\mathbf{H}_2$ is to make sure $k_2$ is far from the resonance condition compared to the resonance width,
\begin{equation}
\RD \equiv \frac{\lvert k_2 -\omega_{\mathrm R}\rvert}{\lvert A_2\rvert} \gg 1.
\end{equation}

The transition amplitude between the two states becomes
\begin{equation}
P(r) = \frac{1}{1+\RD^2}\sin^2(\frac{\Omega_{\mathrm{R}}}{2}t).
\end{equation}
