\section{\label{introduction}Introduction}

In many astrophysical environments neutrinos propagate through dense fluctuating medium, which will interact with neutrinos and dramatically change the flavor oscillations of neutrinos. The significance of matter effect on neutrino flavor oscillations has been demonstrated in Mikheyev–-Smirnov–-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect, which plays a role in solar neutrino oscillations.\cite{wolf78} Another matter effect of interest is parametric resonance of neutrino flavor oscillations due to perturbations in matter.\cite{Krastev1989} Recently matter stimulated neutrino oscillations has been researched using more advanced mathematical tools by Kneller, et al..\cite{Kneller2013,Patton2014} They have shown that many stimulated neutrino oscillations can be explained by resonances of the system. 

In this manuscript, we take a step further and interpret parametric resonance \cite{Akhmedov2000, Krastev1989} as well as other stimulated neutrino oscillations \cite{Kneller2013, Patton2014}, as superpositions of Rabi oscillations. In Sec.~\ref{sec:background}, we define the formalism of neutrino oscillations in matter to be used. In Sec.~\ref{sec:simple} we discuss how neutrino oscillations is related to Rabi oscillations using a very simple model. In Sec.~\ref{sec:jacobi} we show the exact theory of decomposing neutrino oscillations in matter into Rabi oscillations, by applying a specific unitary transformation of the basis and Jacobi-Anger expansion.

\section{\label{sec:background}Background and Formalism}

We consider neutrinos that has only two flavors propagate through matter which is define by electron number density profile $n(x)$. The dynamics of neutrino flavor conversion is determined by Schr\"{o}dinger equation, in which the Hamiltonian is
\begin{equation}
    H =  \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix}
    -\omega_{\mathrm{v}} \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm{v}} + \lambda(x) & \omega_{\mathrm{v}}\sin 2\theta_{\mathrm{v}} \\
   \omega_{\mathrm{v}} \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm{v}} & \omega_{\mathrm{v}} \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm{v}} - \lambda(x)
    \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $\lambda(x)= \sqrt{2}G_F n_e(x)$ and $G_F$ is the Fermi constant. For the convenience of notation, we use Pauli matrices to denote the Hamiltonian, which simplifies the notation of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation,
\begin{equation}
    i\frac{d}{dx}\Psi(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left(  
    (- \omega_{\mathrm{v}} + \lambda(x) ) \sigma_3 + \omega_{\mathrm{v}} \sigma_1 
    \right)
    \Psi(x),
\end{equation}
where $\Psi(x)$ is the wave function in flavor basis. For two flavor system, it is written as $ \Psi(x) = \left(
    \psi_{\mathrm{e}} ,
    \psi_{\mathrm{x}}
    \right)^{\mathrm{T}}$ where $\psi_{\mathrm{e}}$ and $\psi_{\mathrm{x}}$ are the amplitude for electron flavor and the other flavor respectively.

\section{\label{sec:simple}Parametric Resonance and Rabi oscillation --- a simplified model}%


In this section we present a simple picture to explain neutrino parametric resonance in matter by utilizing the theory of Rabi oscillations.

Now consider a system with single frequency matter perturbation in the matter profile $\lambda(x)\equiv\sqrt{2}G_{\mathrm F} n_{\mathrm e}(x)$, which is explicitly written as
\begin{equation}
    \lambda(x) = \lambda_0 + A_1 \sin (k_1 x) ,
    \label{single-frequency-matter-profile}
\end{equation}
where $G_{\mathrm F}$ is the Fermi constant and $n_{\mathrm e}(x)$ is the electron number density in the medium. For better understanding of the transition between states, we use the background matter basis, in which the Hamiltonian is diagonalized in the absence of perturbation $A_1\sin(k_1 x)$, so that the Hamiltonian becomes
\begin{equation}
    H^{(\mathrm{m})} = -\frac{\omega_m}{2} \sigma_3 + \frac{1}{2} A_1 \sin (k_1 x) \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \sigma_3 -\frac{1}{2} A_1  \sin(k_1 x) \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \sigma_1,\label{neutrino-matter-single-frequency-hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_i$ are the Pauli matrices, $\theta_{\mathrm m}$ is the mixing angle in a constant matter profile $\lambda_0$, which is calculated using relation $\tan 2\theta_{\mathrm{m}}=\sin 2\theta_{\mathrm v}/\left( \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm v} - \lambda_0/\omega_{\mathrm v} \right)$ with $\omega_{\mathrm v}$ denoting the vacuum oscillation frequency and $\theta_{\mathrm v}$ denoting the vacuum mixing angle.

%\subsection{Rabi Oscillation}


An optical field interacts with two-level atoms and can stimulate transition from low energy state to high energy state. As the frequency of optical field approaches the energy split of atom, large transition occurs, which is described by Rabi oscillation. Rabi oscillation has been well studied in quantum optics.\cite{Boyd2008} 

The Hamiltonian for Rabi oscillation that we use as an example is
\begin{equation}
    H_{\mathrm R} = - \frac{\omega_{\mathrm R}}{2} - \frac{1}{2}A_{\mathrm{R}} \cos (k_{\mathrm{R}} x) \sigma_1 + \frac{1}{2} A_{\mathrm{R}} \sin (k_{\mathrm{R}} x) \sigma_2,\label{rabi-oscillation-single-perturbation}
\end{equation}
in which $\omega_{\mathrm R}$ serves as the energy split of the two level system, while $A_{\mathrm{R}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{R}}$ are the strength and frequency of the driving field, respectively. Such a system has analytical transition probability from low energy state to high energy state
\begin{equation}
    P(x) = \frac{\left \lvert A_{\mathrm{R}} \right \rvert ^2}{ \Omega_{\mathrm R}^2 } \sin^2 \left( \frac{\Omega_{\mathrm R}}{2} x \right),
    \label{rabi-system-hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\mathrm R} = \sqrt{ \lvert A_{\mathrm{R}}\rvert^2 + (k_{\mathrm{R}} - \omega_{\mathrm R})^2 }
\end{equation} is known as Rabi frequency. The detuning, which is defined as $k_{\mathrm{R}} - \omega_{\mathrm R}$, determines how off-resonance the system is, and amplitude of optical field $A_{\mathrm{R}}$ determines the resonance width. The transition probability oscillates with frequency $\Omega_{\mathrm R}$, however, optical field amplitude $A_1$ is the dominate factor for oscillation frequency when the system is close to resonance.


To make connections with the neutrino system described by Eq.~(\ref{neutrino-matter-single-frequency-hamiltonian}), we argue that the second term in Eq.~(\ref{neutrino-matter-single-frequency-hamiltonian}) and the third term in Eq.~(\ref{rabi-system-hamiltonian}) are not relevant when the systems are close to resonance. \fbox{Which explained rigorously later.}, which indicates that the neutrino oscillation system is a Rabi oscillation system, with external driving field frequency $k_1$ and energy gap $\omega_m$. The resonance condition is determined by matching the energy gap $\omega_m$ with external driving field frequency $k_1$, i.e., $\omega_m \sim k_1$. When the condition is close to resonance, we predict the transition probability using Rabi formula.

To show that this conjecture is correct, we calculate transition probabilities of the neutrinos described by Eq.~(\ref{neutrino-matter-single-frequency-hamiltonian}), and the Rabi oscillations described by Eq.~(\ref{rabi-oscillation-single-perturbation}), with parameters chosen so that the two systems have the same energy split and driving field strength and frequency. In FIG.~\ref{fig-rabiOscillationsNeutrinoCoincidence}, \verb|+| marker shows transition probability of neutrino oscillation in matter, while $\circ$ stands for the numerical result for the corresponding Rabi systems. To show the consistency, we also plotted the result predicted by Rabi formula with black dashed line.

\subsection{Parametric Resonance and MSW Resonance}


\fbox{
\parbox{0.9\columnwidth}{
\begin{itemize}
\item The parametric resonance condition is exactly the condition of Rabi oscillations. 
\item MSW resonance can also be interpreted as Rabi resonance. {\bf This might be a good example of the relation between Rabi oscillation and neutrino oscillation.}
\end{itemize}
}}

For a single frequency perturbation in matter profile $\lambda(x) =\lambda_1 +  A_1\sin(k_1 x)$, P. Krastev and A. Smirnov concluded that the parametric resonance condition is $\omega_{\mathrm{m}} \sim n k_1$, if instantaneous $\omega_{\mathrm{m,inst}}(x)$ varies slowly.\cite{Krastev1989}. This condition is very similar to a Rabi resonance condition when $n=1$. Another well researched profile is a castle wall matter profile, which is periodic and within one period we have
\begin{equation}
    \lambda(x) = \begin{cases} \lambda_2 , &\quad -\frac{X_2}{2}-\frac{X_1}{2}\le x \le -\frac{X_1}{2} \\
\lambda_1, &\quad -\frac{X_1}{2}\le x\le \frac{X_1}{2} \\
\lambda_2, &\quad \frac{X_1}{2}\le x\le \frac{X_1}{2}+\frac{X_2}{2}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The parametric resonance condition derived by E. Akhmedov\cite{Akhmedov2000},
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\tan (\omega_{m1}X_1/2)}{\tan (\omega_{m2}X_2/2)} = - \frac{\cos 2\theta_{m2}}{\cos 2\theta_{m1}},
\end{equation}
where $\omega_{\mathrm{m}i}$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{m}i}$ are the energy difference and mixing angle for matter profile $\lambda_i$ respectively. To show this castle wall matter profiles is related to Rabi oscillation, we decompose the profile using Fourier series,
\begin{equation}
\lambda(x) = \Lambda_0 + \sum_{q=1}^{\infty} \Lambda_q \cos\left( q k_0  x \right),
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{align*}
k_0 &= \frac{2\pi}{X_1+X_2}, \\
\Lambda_0 &= \frac{\lambda_2 X_2 + \lambda_1 X_1}{X}, \\
\lambda_q & = \frac{2}{q\pi} \left( \lambda_2\left( \sin(q \pi ) - \sin(q \pi X_1/X) \right) + \lambda_1 \sin( q\pi X_1/X)  \right).
\end{align*}

To show the transitions due to the variation of matter profile, we rotate to the background matter basis with respect to $\Lambda_0$, in which the transition is zero when variations of matter profile vanishes. The Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
H = - \frac{1}{2}\omega_m \sigma_3  + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{q=1}^{\infty} \Lambda_q \cos\left( k_0 q x \right) \cos 2\theta_m \sigma_3 - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{q=1}^{\infty} \Lambda_q \cos\left( k_0 q x \right) \sin 2\theta_m \sigma_1,
\end{equation}
determines the transitions between the two background matter states.


FIG.~\ref{fig-akhmedovOscPlt} shows the comparison of neutrino transitions between the two matter states. It's clearly shown that these neutrino transitions matches the theory of Rabi oscillation.

\section{\label{sec:jacobi}Parametric Resonance and Rabi oscillation --- Jacobi-Anger expansion}


In this section, we show that the matter effect can be decomposed into superpositions of Rabi oscillations. For a system of single frequency matter perturbation, cf. Eq.~(\ref{single-frequency-matter-profile}), whose Hamiltonian is described by Eq.~(\ref{neutrino-matter-single-frequency-hamiltonian}), we apply an unitary transformation of the form
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{U} =  \begin{pmatrix} e^{-i \eta (x)} & 0 \\  0 & e^{i \eta (x)}  \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
which is a transformation used in \cite{Kneller2006} to remove the diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian. In this work, this transformation is used to remove the varying terms of diagonal elements in the Hamiltonian, so that the energy gap is fixed in the new basis $\left(\ket{\nu_{\mathrm{r1}}},\ket{\nu_{\mathrm{r2}}}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}$, which is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix} \ket{\nu_{\mathrm{r1}}}\\ \ket{\nu_{\mathrm{r2}}} \end{pmatrix} =  \mathbf{U}^\dagger \begin{pmatrix} \ket{\nu_{\mathrm{L}}} \\ \ket{\nu_{\mathrm{H}}} \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
For convenience, we name this new basis the Rabi basis. In Rabi basis, we find the Schr\"{o}dinger equation
\begin{align*}
    &\begin{pmatrix}  \frac{d\eta}{dx}  & 0 \\ 0 & - \frac{d\eta}{dx}  \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{\mathrm r1} \\ \psi_{\mathrm r2} \end{pmatrix} + i \frac{d}{dx} \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{\mathrm r1} \\ \psi_{\mathrm r2} \end{pmatrix} \\
    =&
\left[ -\frac{\omega_m}{2} \sigma_3  + \frac{\delta \lambda}{2} \cos 2\theta_m  \sigma_3  - \frac{\delta \lambda}{2} \sin 2\theta_m \begin{pmatrix} 0 & e^{2i\eta} \\ e^{-2 i\eta } & 0 \end{pmatrix}   \right] \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{\mathrm r1} \\ \psi_{\mathrm r2} \end{pmatrix},
\end{align*}
in which the varying diagonal elements in Hamiltonian is eliminated by choosing $\eta(x)$ properly, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
    \eta(x) - \eta(0) = - \frac{\omega_{\mathrm{m}}}{2} x + \frac{\cos 2\theta_{\mathrm{m}}}{2} \int_0^x \delta\lambda (\tau) d\tau.
\end{equation}
The Schr\"{o}dinger equation becomes
\begin{equation}
    i \frac{d}{dx} \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{\mathrm r1} \\ \psi_{\mathrm r2} \end{pmatrix} = \left[ - \frac{\omega_{\mathrm m}}{2} \sigma_3 - \frac{\delta \lambda}{2} \sin 2\theta_m \begin{pmatrix} 0 & e^{2i\eta} \\ e^{-2 i\eta } & 0 \end{pmatrix}\right] \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{\mathrm r1} \\ \psi_{\mathrm r2} \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $\eta(x) = - A_1 \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \cos (k_1 x)/(2 k) $ for the Hamiltonian Eq.~(\ref{neutrino-matter-single-frequency-hamiltonian}).  One can easily show that the transition probability between two eigenstates in Rabi basis is the same as the transition probability between two eigenstates in background matter basis.

To make a connection with Rabi oscillation, we apply Jacobi-Anger expansion, which is used in \cite{Kneller2013}, to decompose the $\exp\left( i z \cos\left(\Phi \right) \right)$-like term in Hamiltonian into linear combinations of terms that is proportional to $\exp\left(i n \Phi \right)$. The final form of Hamiltonian that show the Hamiltonian is a summation of Rabi systems is
\begin{equation}
    H^{(\mathrm{r})} = -\frac{\omega_{\mathrm{m}}}{2} -  \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty B_n \begin{pmatrix}
    0 &  \Phi_n e^{i (n k_1-\omega_{\mathrm{m}}) x} \\
     \Phi_n^* e^{ - i (n k_1 -\omega_{\mathrm{m}}) x} & 0
    \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align*}
    B_n &= \tan 2\theta_{\mathrm m} n k_1 J_{n} \left( \frac{A_1}{k_1}\cos 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \right),\\
    \Phi_n &= e^{i\pi (3n/2+1)}.
\end{align*}
The constant phase $\Phi_n$ doesn't play any role in the transition probability since it only determines the initial direction of Hamiltonian. For the same reason, phase in matter profile is not included. As such systems can be graphically represented on a Bloch sphere, the second term in the Hamiltonian is the many driving fields of the system. It can also be derived for arbitrary multi-frequency matter profile,
\begin{equation}
    \lambda(x) = \lambda_0 + \sum_n A_n \sin (n k_n)
\end{equation}
that the Hamiltonian also takes a form of summations of Rabi oscillations,
\begin{equation}
    H^{(\mathrm r)} = -\frac{\omega_{\mathrm m}}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n_1=-\infty}^\infty \cdots \sum_{n_N = -\infty}^\infty B_N 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & \Phi_N e^{i\left( \sum_a n_a k_a - \omega_{\mathrm{m}}\right)x} \\
    \Phi_N^* e^{-i\left( \sum_a n_a k_a - \omega_{\mathrm{m}}\right)x} & 0
    \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align*}
    B_N &=  \tan 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \left( \sum_a n_a k_a \right) \left( \prod_a J_{n_a}\left( \frac{A_a}{k_a}\cos 2\theta_m \right) \right),\\
    \Phi_N &= e^{i\pi (3\sum_a n_a/2+1)}.
\end{align*}

The following sections will determine the important modes of the system (i.e., which $n$ to include) and explore the interference between modes hence explain the coincidence presented in the previous sections. For numerical calculations, we use dimensionless quantities which are scaled using the characteristic energy scale $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$, e.g.,
\begin{align*}
    \hat x &= \omega_{\mathrm{m}}x, \\
    \hat k_1 & = \frac{k_1}{\omega_{\mathrm{m}}}, \\
    \hat A_1 & = \frac{A_1}{\omega_{\mathrm{m}}}, \\
    \hat B_n &= \frac{B_n}{\omega_{\mathrm{m}}}.
\end{align*}

    

\subsection{The Important Factors}


\fbox{
\parbox{0.9\columnwidth}{
\begin{itemize}
            \item Width of resonance $B$
            \item Deviation from exact resonance $g$, called {\bf{detuning}} (value).
            \item Oscillation wavelength of mode (determined by Rabi frequency, which is in turn related to $B$ and $g$ ) compared to size of physical system
\end{itemize}
}}


For illustration purpose, we use single frequency matter profile to demonstrate the important factors in this system. To determine the important modes, the resonance width for each mode which is determined by $B_n$, the deviation from exact resonance (i.e., detuning) which is calculated as $\lvert n k_1 - \omega_{\mathrm{m}} \rvert$, and oscillation wavelength of each mode compared to the size of the physical system should be considered. By utilizing the theory of Rabi oscillation, we know that the oscillation wavelength of each mode is determined by the Rabi frequency $\Omega_n$.

More specifically, we define the resonance quality $Q_n = \lvert B_n/( n k_1 - \omega_{\mathrm{m}}  )\rvert$, which measures how well the resonance is. For exact resonance, $Q_n=0$, while large $Q_n$ says the system is too far away from the resonance of this specific mode. FIG.~\ref{fig-modes-and-detuning} explains the meaning of $Q_n$. Small $Q_n$ modes are the modes that are dramatically important to the system, on the other hand, modes that has much larger oscillation wavelength are not subjected to be considered even though their $Q_n$'s are close to zero, which is due to the fact that such modes have not accumulated much transition probabilities within the size of the physical system.


\begin{figure}[!htbp]

}


Similar quantities are to be considered for multi-frequency matter profile, such as the resonance width of each mode $B_N$, detuning $\lvert \sum_a n_a k_a - \omega_{\mathrm{m}} \rvert$, and Rabi frequency $\Omega_N$, as well as $Q_N =\lvert B_N/( \sum_a n_a k_a - \omega_{\mathrm{m}}  )\rvert$.

                \caption{Reduction of transition amplitudes. Black dashed line: the system has only one perturbation which is at exact resonance; Green dash-dotted line: $A_2=A_{2,\mathrm{Critical}}=0.0083666\omega_{\mathrm m}$; Blue dotted line: $A_2=0.01\omega_{\mathrm m}$; Red line: $A_2=0.02\omega_{\mathrm m}$. The markers are the probabilities predicted using Rabi formula correspondingly. Black cross is the transition probability between two background mass eigenstates for the neutrinos with matter perturbation $A\sin(kx)$. During the calculation, $\lambda_0$ is set to $0.5$ of the MSW resonance requirement.}
