\section{\label{introduction}Introduction}

In many astrophysical environments neutrinos propagate through dense fluctuating medium, which will interact with neutrinos and dramatically change the flavor oscillations of neutrinos. The significance of matter effect on neutrino flavor oscillations has been demonstrated in Mikheyev–-Smirnov–-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect, which plays a role in solar neutrino oscillations.\cite{wolf78} Another matter effect of interest is parametric resonance of neutrino flavor oscillations due to perturbations in matter.\cite{Krastev1989} Recently matter stimulated neutrino oscillations has been researched using more advanced mathematical tools by Kneller, et al..\cite{Kneller2013,Patton2014} They have shown that many stimulated neutrino oscillations can be explained by resonances of the system. 

In this manuscript, we take a step further and interpret matter effect, parametric resonance \cite{Akhmedov2000, Krastev1989} and stimulated neutrino oscillations \cite{Kneller2013, Patton2014}, as superposition of Rabi oscillations. In the second section we show that the neutrino oscillations in matter is related to Rabi oscillations by calculating the flavor transition probabilities and resonance conditions. \fbox{BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF THE NEXT SECTIONS} By applying a specific unitary transformation of the basis, we can rewrite the system into a superposition of Rabi oscillations and investigate the resonances of each mode, as well as the interferences between the modes.



\section{\label{rabi}Neutrino Oscillations in Matter and Rabi Oscillation}%


%% Introduction to neutrino oscillations in matter


In this section we present the coincidence between neutrino oscillations in matter and Rabi oscillation using two simple neutrino oscillation systems. 

The first example to consider is one with single frequency perturbation in the matter profile $\lambda(x)\equiv\sqrt{2}G_{\mathrm F} n_{\mathrm e}(x)$, which is explicitly written as
\begin{equation}
    \lambda(x) = \lambda_0 + A_1 \sin (k_1 x) ,
\end{equation}
where $G_{\mathrm F}$ is the Fermi constant and $n_{\mathrm e}(x)$ is the electron number density in the medium. For better understanding of the transition between states, we use the background matter basis, in which the Hamiltonian is diagonalized in the absence of perturbation $A_1\sin(k_1 x)$, so that the Hamiltonian becomes
\begin{equation}
    H^{(\mathrm{m})} = -\frac{\omega_m}{2} \sigma_3 + \frac{1}{2} A_1 \sin (k_1 x) \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \sigma_3 -\frac{1}{2} A_1  \sin(k_1 x) \sin 2\theta_{\mathrm m} \sigma_1,\label{neutrino-matter-single-frequency-hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_i$ are the Pauli matrices, $\theta_{\mathrm m}$ is the mixing angle in a constant matter profile $\lambda_0$, which is calculated using relation $\tan 2\theta_{\mathrm{m}}=\sin 2\theta_{\mathrm v}/\left( \cos 2\theta_{\mathrm v} - \lambda_0/\omega_{\mathrm v} \right)$ with $\omega_{\mathrm v}$ denoting the vacuum oscillation frequency and $\theta_{\mathrm v}$ denoting the vacuum mixing angle.

\subsection{Rabi Oscillation}


An optical field interacts with two-level atoms and can stimulate transition from low energy state to high energy state. As the frequency of optical field approaches the energy split of atom, large transition occurs, which is described by Rabi oscillation. Rabi oscillation has been well studied in quantum optics.\cite{Boyd2008} 

The Hamiltonian for Rabi oscillation that we use as an example is
\begin{equation}
    H_{\mathrm R} = - \frac{\omega_{\mathrm R}}{2} - \frac{1}{2}A_{\mathrm{R}} \cos (k_{\mathrm{R}} x) \sigma_1 + \frac{1}{2} A_{\mathrm{R}} \sin (k_{\mathrm{R}} x) \sigma_2,\label{rabi-oscillation-single-perturbation}
\end{equation}
in which $\omega_{\mathrm R}$ serves as the energy split of the two level system, while $A_{\mathrm{R}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{R}}$ are the strength and frequency of the driving field, respectively. Such a system has analytical transition probability from low energy state to high energy state
\begin{equation}
    P(x) = \frac{\left \lvert A_{\mathrm{R}} \right \rvert ^2}{ \Omega_{\mathrm R}^2 } \sin^2 \left( \frac{\Omega_{\mathrm R}}{2} x \right),
    \label{rabi-system-hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega_{\mathrm R} = \sqrt{ \lvert A_{\mathrm{R}}\rvert^2 + (k_{\mathrm{R}} - \omega_{\mathrm R})^2 }$ is known as Rabi frequency. The detuning, which is defined as $k_{\mathrm{R}} - \omega_{\mathrm R}$, determines how off-resonance the system is, and amplitude of optical field $A_{\mathrm{R}}$ determines the resonance width. The transition probability oscillates with frequency $\Omega_{\mathrm R}$, however, optical field amplitude $A_1$ is the dominate factor for oscillation frequency when the system is close to resonance.


To make connections with the neutrino system described by Eq.~(\ref{neutrino-matter-single-frequency-hamiltonian}), we argue that the second term in Eq.~(\ref{neutrino-matter-single-frequency-hamiltonian}) and the third term in Eq.~(\ref{rabi-system-hamiltonian}) are not relevant when the systems are close to resonance. \fbox{Which explained rigorously later.}, which indicates that the neutrino oscillation system is a Rabi oscillation system, with external driving field frequency $k_1$ and energy gap $\omega_m$. The resonance condition is determined by matching the energy gap $\omega_m$ with external driving field frequency $k_1$, i.e., $\omega_m \sim k_1$. When the condition is close to resonance, we predict the transition probability using Rabi formula.

To show that this conjecture is correct, we calculate transition probabilities of the neutrinos described by Eq.~(\ref{neutrino-matter-single-frequency-hamiltonian}), and the Rabi oscillations described by Eq.~(\ref{rabi-oscillation-single-perturbation}), with parameters chosen so that the two systems have the same energy split and driving field strength and frequency. In FIG.~\ref{fig-rabiOscillationsNeutrinoCoincidence}, \verb|+| marker shows transition probability of neutrino oscillation in matter, while $\circ$ stands for the numerical result for the corresponding Rabi systems. To show the consistency, we also plotted the result predicted by Rabi formula with black dashed line.
